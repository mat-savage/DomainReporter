# DomainReporter
ArcMap Addin: Reports codes and values from Coded Value Domains for layers in a map.

Choose a layer in the map (only layer types that support domains are available), 
a subtype (if your data doesn't have subtypes, it just uses the default), 
and a field to report coded value domains from.

Press Show Domain Values button to view a popup with domain values. Lists longer than 15 will be truncated. 
Press Yes to copy domain codes and values to a tab seperated list (excel paste-able) and close the window, or No to simply close the window.
